'Some pigs were born last night.'\n\n'I don't see why he needs an ax,' continued Fern, who was only eight.\n\n'Well,' said her mother, 'one of the pigs is a runt. It's very small and weak, and it will never amount to anything. So your father has decided to do away with it.'",

Rain fell in the yard and ran in crooked courses down into the lane.\n\n'Charlotte,' said Wilbur, after a while, 'why are you so quiet?'\n\n'I like to keep still,' she said. 'I've always been rather quiet.'",

Your father and I have decided that you're old enough to take on more responsibility.'\n\n'What kind of responsibility?' asked Fern.\n\n'We'd like you to start helping more around the house and spend less time at the barn.'",
